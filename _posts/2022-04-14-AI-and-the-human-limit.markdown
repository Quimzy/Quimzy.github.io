Since the first years of AI, developers and engineers have dealt with AI as a digital copy of the human brain. AI mimicks various systems in nature, and the most effective one until now are Neural Networks. And, it works fine, it's actually really good. An AI agent powered by Deep Learning & Neural Networks is the closest thing we have to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). This technique has enabled DeepBlue <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov"> to defeat Kasparov in chess </a>, AlpghaGo <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol"> to defeat Lee Sedol in Go </a>, Openpilot & Autopilot to make self-driving cars.

But, like anything the human brain has its flaws. As technology progresses, new problems will emerge and it will require better solutions.
