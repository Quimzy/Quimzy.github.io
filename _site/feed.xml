<p>Look around, every technology and platform you are using is only the result of updates of an idea that has came out before the past decade. There are no breakthroughs in any these: Social Media, Search Engines, Video Sharing, etc… Most of the apps that are thriving in those areas are mostly from the 2000s or the late ’90s and ’80s. Google (1998), Amazon (1994), Facebook (2004), Tesla (2003)…</p>

<p><strong>Except for AI</strong></p>

<p>Tons of breakthroughs have happened in multiple fields in AI. If you compare Google Translate now with Google Translate 10 years ago, you can see MASSIVE progress in language translation &amp; detection, it’s enhancing almost everyday. The same goes with Self-Driving cars, with Tesla’s Autopilot and Comma’s Openpilot proving that we are getting closer to level 3&amp;4 each day. Computers are getting more intelligent &amp; capable on an enormous rate, and no one can disagree with that.</p>

<p><strong>Now let’s see humans…</strong></p>

<p>Some would say that humans’ intelligence is still growing in a slow linear way and others would say that we are getting dumber in a fast linear way. I don’t care about both views, i only care about that term, <strong>Linear</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at this graph: (The exponential growth being the AI’s &amp; The linear being Human’s)</p>

<p><img src="https://finstart.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/linear-vs-exponential-5.png" alt="Exponential vs Linear Growth" title="Exponential &amp; Linear" /></p>

<p>There’s a point where both plots intersect, a.k.a the Singularity. Personally, to know when that point is, we have to look at when humans would be at their maximum stage of dumbness, numbness and consumer-mentality.</p>

<p>And, that’s estimated to be when kids born in 2000 to 2019 grows up (medium age of 35). After the 2000s system’s factory produced the dumbest generation in the modern era, which then triggers the post-modern era. The first era where humans don’t play a big role in.</p>

<p>The Singularity is most likely to take place in late 2030s - mid 2040s, thanks to Dumb People.</p>

<p>I found myself thinking about a lot of things, so why not tell some of them to the world.</p>

<p>Some would say that i am the founder of <a href="https://github.com/Quirk-io/">Quirk.io</a></p>

<p>I am also a noob scientist, interested in Math, AI &amp; the future.</p>
