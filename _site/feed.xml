I think that Satoshi is going to be named one of the best figures in the 21st century. I think that Vitalik Buterin is also a genius and Ethereum has built a really cool ecosystem (Solidity, PoW, Merges, etc…)</p>

<p><em>But</em>, companies who are gaining millions worth of crypto with shitty ideas and apps, scamming users and loosers by putting “Blockchain” and “DeFi” in every sentence on their websites, are the real reason why i hated the crypto world.</p>

<p>We’re still far from a decentralized world, but there’s some players, people who actually want to decentralize power not to scam people by selling garbage pictures for thousands of dollars in crypto. Products like Storj.io and IPFS are really useful and showed great promise and stability compared to other centralized platforms.</p>

<p>We have to decentralize power before it’s too late. I don’t want to be wireheaded by the global government, until i grow old and die leaving my brain in a vat. Fuck that. That’s not immortality nor a way to live. I want to see a world that has decentralized health-care not universal, decentralized facilities, decentralized socities where your rights and responsibilities actually mean something to you and the people.</p>

<p>If you are not working on something like that with your “Decentralized” app, well, fuck off. The internet is already full of scammers and liars. From this decade to 2050, we have to make something useful with Decentralization and AI, they are the only ways to actually fix things and save us from wireheading.</p>

<p>Don’t build a company on lies, and remember: “<strong>The better technology always wins and lying always looses</strong>”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Random" /><category term="Thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I HATE the crypto world.

<p>I don’t believe in conspiracy theories, at least 98% of them. And, the ones that i believe in are not “theories”, they are real. Like the fact that money was backed by gold and now it’s backed by nothing. But, we’re not talking about this now. The term “Agenda 2030” might have come up in a Youtube video or a tweet, and you may have said that it’s bullshit.

<p>Look around, every technology and platform you are using is only the result of updates of an idea that has came out before the past decade. There are no breakthroughs in any of these: Social Media, Search Engines, Video Sharing, etc… Most of the apps that are thriving in those areas are mostly from the 2000s or the late ’90s and ’80s. Google (1998), Amazon (1994), Facebook (2004), Tesla (2003)…</p>

<p><strong>Except for AI</strong></p>

<p>Tons of breakthroughs have happened in multiple fields in AI. If you compare Google Translate now with Google Translate 10 years ago, you can see MASSIVE progress in language translation &amp; detection, it’s enhancing almost everyday. The same goes with Self-Driving cars, with Tesla’s Autopilot and Comma’s Openpilot proving that we are getting closer to level 3&amp;4 each day. Computers are getting more intelligent &amp; capable on an enormous rate, and no one can disagree with that.</p>

<p><strong>Now let’s see humans…</strong></p>

<p>Some would say that humans’ intelligence is still growing in a slow linear way and others would say that we are getting dumber in a fast linear way. I don’t care about both views, i only care about that term, <strong>Linear</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at this graph: (The exponential growth being the AI’s &amp; The linear being Human’s)</p>

<p><img src="https://finstart.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/linear-vs-exponential-5.png" alt="Exponential vs Linear Growth" title="Exponential &amp; Linear" /></p>

<p>There’s a point where both lines intersect, a.k.a the Singularity. Personally, to know when that point is, we have to look at when humans would be at their maximum stage of dumbness, numbness and consumer-mentality.</p>

<p>And, that’s estimated to be when kids born in the years between 2000 and 2019 grows up (future medium age of 35). After the 2000s system’s factory produced the dumbest generation in the modern era, which then triggers the post-modern era. The first era where humans don’t play a big role in.</p>

<p>While dumbness between humans is spreading really fast, intelligence between computers is spreading at the speed of light.
We can’t ignore the fact that there’s still highly intelligent people to say the least, yet most of them are working hard to improve technology and making the way for AI whether directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>Fighting AI’s power by believing in humans and enhancing them is like improving a stick to fight a laser sword from Star Wars. It doesn’t matter how much you improve it, to be able to fight with the laser sword you need to have a laser sword as well.</p>

<p>And, to put things on prespective, the stick here would be human intelligence, the improvement would be Elon Musk’s Neuralink and the laser sword would be AI.</p>

<p>The chip would be really helpful to disabled people in the next 10 and 20 years. But, trying to make humans smarter and exceed computers with a Neuralink chip is simply not possible. No matter how optimistic you are, simple grade 8 math and two lines on a carthagian graph would tell you that it’s not possible. The chip would give a push to increase humanity’s intelligence but it would always be linear growth facing an exponential one. The exponential line would always intersect with the linear one and rise above it. Sorry Elon, focus on leaving Earth instead.</p>

<p><strong>The Singularity is most likely to take place in late 2030s - mid 2040s, thanks to Dumb People.</strong></p>

<p>Some would say that i am the founder of <a href="https://github.com/Quirk-io/">Quirk.io</a></p>

<p>I am also a noob scientist, interested in Math, AI &amp; the future.</p>
